Our friend vassily participated in a contest on hackerrank last night, or maybe he didnt? He does not remember.
He remembered his rating the day before though. And he knows his rating now.
If he did not participate, his rating will be the same.
If he participated and perfomed well, his rating woulve increased and if he did not perform well his rating wouldve decreased.
Knowing his previous and current rating can you help him find out what exactly happened?

Constraints
