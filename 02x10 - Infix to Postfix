"""
A postfix expression is of the form instead of the traditional infix expression which follows the form .
Your task is to write a program that takes advantage of the stack data structure and converts a given infix expression into its postfix expression.

INPUT
There will be only a single line of input, the string that denotes the infix expression to be converted into its postfix counterpart.
There are four arithmetic operations and capital letters used as variables/operands.

Look at the sample Input/Output for clarity

OUTPUT
Output the final postfix expression after converting it to postfix from infix.

Sample Input 0
A+B
Sample Output 0
AB+
