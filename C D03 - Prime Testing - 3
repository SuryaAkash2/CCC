You are given Q different queries. Each query consists of one number each i.e. N. You are to write a program that,
for each query tests whether the number is prime or not. You must output Q different lines to stdout,
ith line being "yes" if the N for ith query is a prime number and "no" otherwise.

Input Format
First line contains one integer, the number of queries Q.
Next Q lines contain one integer each, the N for the queries.

Constraints
1 <= Q <= 10^6
1 <= N <= 10^6

Output Format
Output Q lines, on each line you must print "yes" or "no" depending on the primality of the N in the query.
