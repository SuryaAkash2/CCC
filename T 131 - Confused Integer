"""
Our beloved integer X is confused. He was told that he is a positive integer which fits in a 32 bit signed integer 
that can be expressed as A^P where P > 1 and A > 0 where A and P both should be integers. Now he wonders, 
there is a possibility that he does not exist at all because he does not satisfy the A^P expressibility condition. 
Given the values of A and P, find out if X exists or not.

Input Format
Input contains the value of integer X.

Constraints
0 < X < 2x10^9

Output Format
Output "yes" if X can be expressed as A^P and "no" otherwise.

Sample Input 0
4
Sample Output 0
yes
Explanation 0
Yes as 2^2 = 4
