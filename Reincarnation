In the world of numbers every number dies at some point and reincarnates. The newer generation will always surpass the previous generation and hence every number X upon 
incarnation will be promoted with a power Y i.e. X will now become X raised to the power Y. The god of the world of numbers needs a small break and hence has given you the 
task of reincarnating the incoming numbers after raising them to the power Y.
