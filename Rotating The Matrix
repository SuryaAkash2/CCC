"""
Thomas, a computer programmer, is led to fight an underground war against powerful computers who now rule the world with a system called 'The Matrix'.
To win against the system, he must rotate the Matrix clockwise by an angle of 90 degrees.
Unfortunately the system has wiped Thomas' memory and it is now in your hands to save the world.
The matrix can be considered as a 2Dimensional Array of size NxN.

SEE THE SAMPLE INPUT OUTPUT FOR CLARITY

Input Format
The first line contains the size of the matrix N.
The next N lines contain N integers each, together denoting the square matrix of size NxN.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10

Output Format
Output the final matrix after rotation.

Sample Input 0

1 2
3 4
Sample Output 0
3 1
4 2
