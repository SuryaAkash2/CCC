"""
Consider a binary string, s, with an initial value of "0". We expand s by performing the following steps:

Create a string, t, where each character ti is equal to 1 - si. For example, if s = "01", then t = "10".
Note that s and t always have the same length because t is the complement of s.
Append t to the end of s so that s(new) = s + t. In the example above, "01" becomes "0110".
We keep on expanding s using steps 1 and 2 infinitely. When we repeat the expansion operation, string s grows like this:

Given queries in the form of a zero-based index, , solve each query by printing the character at index in on a new line.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer denoting q (number of queries). Each of the q subsequent lines contains an integer describing the value of x for a query.

Constraints
0 <= x, q <= 1000
Output Format
For each query, print the value of s[x] (i.e., either 1 or 0) on a new line.
